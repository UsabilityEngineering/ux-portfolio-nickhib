When I first obtained this air fryer. I had no experience with such a thing before this moment. All prior experience I had with something of this caliber was either a microwave or stove. This was the first time I used such a machine. I had a bit of a shock on how to use it.

The first thing that I tried to do with the air fryer is cooking some hot pockets. So I stuffed some hot pockets into the air fryer my first reaction was to turn the temp time knob to the right and then press the start/stop button but I did that and there wasn't a chance. This can be a bad example of **mapping** because when one sees a knob with temp included in it without reading into their first reaction might be to turn that knob and go.  What it did was change the temp and time of the preheat function so it never got to the temperature of 350 degrees. This lead me never to start the oven because it was not the right temperature.

Second, I attempted to press the temp/time button because I thought maybe by pressing it once id be able to change just the heat, and that worked. I turned right on the temp knob then the temp could not go above 195 degrees for some reason. I could not figure it out at the time and I didn't have the patience to deal with this oddity. This could be an example of bad **learnability** I mean if the consumer is just giving up on it then their definitely a problem there 

Third, after a month had passed I had something else to cook and couldn't use my oven so I decided to give this toaster oven a final try. I went to it shoved in some chicken nuggets and then I started to look at it in more depth and then I realized that the interface to the top left said preheat as the selected function. I was confused about why that was and then it hit me that's why it couldn't go above a certain temperature.

fourth, after learning that the function knob had a purpose, I turned it to see what would happen. It took me scrolling through a menu with what seemed to be 10 different settings and I set it on what seemed to be the cook setting and then I pressed the button for time and set it for 25 mins. Finally, I pressed to start with the correct functionality I wanted. When it was done it was perfectly cooked so I would say that it was **effective** once it worked 

In general, I did not like this design whatsoever the way the inputs were placed and designed made me instinctively go through a loop in the process of cooking when I first tried to use it. My eyes just went to temp and time like that was the magic fix all. This could say something about how humans look for information. Maybe we look for what we currently need the most, so pinpoint information. The part that frustrated me the most was the knob where it was placed and the visuals, to tell the user what it's for mislead me for a while and that's why I feel as though this doesn't have the best **learnability**. I can say the **memorability** is great once I learned how to use it. I didn't have to spend time relearning so I'm **satisfied** with that. In the end, it did produce the product that I wanted so I will say it worked **efficiently** and **effectively**.

I would have designed this differently I'm sure that if one would have done some usability studies on this air fryer others may have had the same problem. So I would have conducted a study with a **protocol** and found out all the issues and tried to alleviate them to some degree. I don't think I would have gone for a knob for functions. Instead, I would have put two buttons up and down next to the interface and then had visuals saying change functions, where the eye can easily see. Instead of where they ended up putting it. Where it was clearly out of the way for those that are tall. And then I would have tested my design with a walkthrough. This would have been a better approach I believe
(p.s i could not obtain anymore photos gave it away)
