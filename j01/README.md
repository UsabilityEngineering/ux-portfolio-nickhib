When i first obtained this air fryer. I had no experience with such a thing before this moment. All prior experince i had with something of this caliber was either a microwave or stove. This was the first time i used this such a machine. I had a bit of a shock on how to use it.The first thought that came to my mind was i just have to turn the temperature knob and start the air fryer on. I turned it on with that action in thought but what i found was the temperature was not changing when i turned the temperature knob. What i had found was that, i had to choose a function first, then turn the temperature knob to change the temperature. If one wanted a timer on, they would have to turn the timer on then use the temperature knob to set the time. The **mapping** of the air fryer did not help my understanding at all while learning the machine. The text for the knobs is right below the knob for temperature and function.When one is looking from above it becomes harder to see. Their are no visuals on the screen that makes this process more **learnable** for the user.However it is very **effective** for cooking snacks such as chicken nuggets.it does this **effeciently** making the process **satifying** for my use.i think i would have preffered some kind of **natural mapping** maybe this would have made the learning process easier for the user.
