<p>This ring scanner is a tool given to those that work at FedEx to scan the packages and sort them to the correct trucks to be delivered. the picture above is the scanner I used in the warehouse. We are not allowed to take pictures in the warehouse or even bring our phones into the building so I found this photo on google. They have given out the same scanner for about 10 years or so. This equipment is very old and is in need of a revamp because it is slow dysfunctional and just plain hard to use. One cannot even learn how to use this device without the help of others, such as your coworker or boss. 
	<p>First, when I grabbed one of these I thought that I would need to push a button to scan the box and then set it into the van. I couldn't have been any more wrong. There are no instructions on the device and you are greeted by a foreign screen with options that are also foreign to you. I can't remember all the options on the scanner but the one I used out of the 20 that was there, is the third option “load assist”. My first thought on this was there is no way we need to use this option because I'm not assisting anyone with loading? So I kept searching through other options and was getting to know where then I asked a coworker where to go. Then I choose the load assist option then a new menu came up with 4 options. The 2 options that I was told to use were the small sort option and the trailer load scan. I came to my own conclusion about choosing the trailer load scan because that made the most sense to me because we are hired to load trucks. The other option I used small sort, I had no idea what to use that for and I had to get some guidance on how to use this option. When pressed the small sort brings you to an empty list of 6 and two options open bag and close bag. I had no idea what this was used for, I tried to figure it out myself by first choosing the open bag option to see if that would do anything, this brought open a menu where one can type it seemed like with an option like continue or exit right under. I figured I could just type something and that would be my bag identifier or something, so I tried to do so but I kept getting errors and I became stuck. I asked for guidance from a coworker at this point and found out that I have to get a special bar code and a bag. You scan the barcode then press continue and that will be added to your empty list from before. I stuck the barcode onto the bag like I was instructed to then I was told to scan the barcodes that were on the packages coming down the conveyor belt. It was simple enough to scan the small packages and click the bag you opened and the small package will be assigned to that bag. Closing the bag was simple when the bag became full I just simply chose the option to close the bag instead of the open bag option. This would delete it from my bag list then one would just scan the barcode on the bag to the trailer and send it on its way. Go back to when I said I used two options trailer load and small load I will talk about the trailer load option, this was the first option I ever used I chose the option on the scanner and came up to a screen that had an empty list with the option to add a van I don't think I ever saw an option to delete a van though. I was going to load a trailer so I figured I would press add a van. When I chose that option it allowed me to manually type in a van number but the thing is when I tried to type in the numbers nothing. I thought maybe it was just the system glitching so I restart it but the same thing I finally got up to ask about what was going on and apparent one need to press v on the scanner and then type the van number in click enter then one has to type in wa then the number for the work area. I could not have known this without help even after working there for a couple of years. This entire system is overly complicated and it is impossible to easily teach new employees how to use this system this means the usability of this device is very poor not to mention it barely is able to do the job correctly. The scanner piece that one puts on their finger is so inaccurate that it will take one a long time to scan a package. When I scanned packages it sometimes would stop working altogether and my first reaction was to hit it and that worked and got it to go again.

<p>In summary, the system is very bad it is not efficient, learnable, memorable, or effective. This system is not **efficient** because the scanner is so old that it can barely scan the barcodes on the packages. half the time the whole scanner would just crash then one would have to reboot it to get it to work again. Not to mention that this scanner can only hold maybe 5 trucks for you to scan to. So someone like me that moves around helping everyone cant really do this because there are a lot more than 5 trucks. This system is not **learnable** at all when new hires come on it always takes weeks for them to learn. The reason for this is that there isn't any **natural mapping** or any systems that are recognizable so people can easily get confused. It's not **memorable because** it takes weeks for people to actually remember the steps to take to complete their tasks. This is probably because there are so many steps to do little things and so many menus to go through. This is also not as **effective** as it could be one can see this when they try to scan a package and it takes 5 minutes because the scanner is acting up. So in general this system could use a tune-up or a rehaul so that people are more able to use such an item. Some ways they could improve this item is to make it a touch screen with apps like a phone. They could also call the apps the things that they are actually supposed to do as well so it's easier to learn. People now in days are very used to phones so this would be good to do. Upgrade the scanner so it can actually read the barcodes so one can be more efficient and effective in scanning. Making the ring scanner wireless too would help. It can be improved through some usability tests if I were in charge I would do a survey to see what is most important then I would do a number of tests like seeing how other people use it and fix the things with the most fault. I would make a mock wireframe of the phone-like interface for this item as well then test that. There is a lot one could do to make this better then it is
